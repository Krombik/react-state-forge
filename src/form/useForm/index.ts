/**
 * Makes a form over the {@link control}. The fields and validators under its
 * `FormProvider` register with it, and it sweeps, submits and resets them
 * together.
 *
 * The {@link control} is what gets submitted and what `reset` restores, whole -
 * paths no field is mounted on included. `$isValid` comes from the validators
 * that registered, so a rule over some other control still blocks the submit.
 *
 * The form itself lasts as long as the component, and so does the
 * {@link control}: it is read once - a form is over the one control for its
 * life, and a component that has to switch has to remount. A submit handler is
 * given to `handleSubmit` at render, so that one closes over fresh values.
 *
 * `$isDirty` compares against the baseline: what the {@link control} held when
 * the form mounted, then whatever a `reset` left. Only what sits under the
 * {@link control} has one - a field over another control is swept and submitted
 * like the rest, but reads as never dirty. A submit doesn't move it -
 * `reset(control, values)` from the handler is what makes what was sent the new
 * one. Over an async control it is the first value a load hands over, so waiting
 * for data is not an edit and the fields start clean.
 *
 * A reload after that is a value like any other: it overwrites what is being
 * edited and the form reads as dirty against what it first got. Whoever asked
 * for the reload is who knows whether what came back should replace the edits -
 * `reset(control, values)` is how they say so. Disable the fields on
 * `selectLoading` if the control can reload while the form is open.
 *
 * @param validateOn When the validators under it run on their own, unless one
 *   of them says otherwise (default: `'submit'`).
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const $values = useControl({ email: '' });
 *
 * const form = useForm($values, 'blur');
 *
 * const save = form.handleSubmit((values) => api.save(values));
 *
 * return (
 *   <FormProvider form={form}>
 *     <form onSubmit={save}>
 *       <Validator
 *         control={$values.email}
 *         validate={(email) => (email.includes('@') ? undefined : 'invalid email')}
 *         render={($error) => <ControlConsumer control={$error} />}
 *       />
 *       <NativeField type='email' control={$values.email} render={(props) => <input {...props} />} />
 *     </form>
 *   </FormProvider>
 * );
 * ```
